					<h2>Prompt 4: Make predictions about the book.</h2>
					<h5>Feburay 14, 2020</h5>
					<p>Aspen Quick is shown to have a very powerful ability in the first few chapters of the book. The book wastes no time bragging about it as well, on page 10 Aspen thinks, “[I like] showing off just good I was at this stuff. Because I was very good at it.” Almost all conflicts in the first few chapters are solved with his ability. 
					<span class="dots"></span><span class="more">
					For example, he wants his crush to break up with her boyfriend, he uses his power, he’s too drunk to drive home, he uses his power. It goes on like this. With this line of plot, I can only imagine that very soon something will happen to disrupt his power. This will probably be one of the main plots in the book as it seems to be the only way to have a meaningful conflict.

					<h2>Prompt 7: Describe the mood of the story. </h2>
					<h5>Feburay 23, 2020</h5>
					
					<p>The mood of the story was always present, but now that I’ve read to page 197 the mood has really intensified in the last few chapters. We get a glimpse of what the mood will be right from the start—the very first chapter is about<span class="dots"></span><span class="more"> Aspen Quick using his power to break up his best friend and his crushes relationship. Then for the next few chapters the mood of teenage romance is fairly subdued but not forgotten. Then near page 160 it comes roaring back. By 193 there were mean parts like, “And before I could figure out how to reply, Leah was kissing me.” I don’t need to hear about Aspens many love interests for 20 pages on end but that's what the author is feeding me. If I had to describe the mood in one sentence it would be: Romantic mystery mixed with abounding teenage passion and drama. </p></span>

					<h2>Prompt 9: Compare book characters to other characters. </h2>
					<h5>March 10, 2020</h5>
					
					<p>In Rocks Fall Everyone Dies all the members of the Quick family are able to steal thoughts and emotions from other people but how each member of the family uses this power is unique. The main character of the book is Aspen Quick and he shows how easily he uses his power right in the beginning of the book.<span class="dots"></span><span class="more"> He uses it to break up this friend's relationship without even giving it a second thought. He continues to use his power almost indiscriminately and without much thought throughout the book, but he does follow the family rule: “Don’t steal from other family members.” His dad on the other hand steals thoughts from other family members many times in the book, and he often used his power even more recklessly than Apen. Both of these characters are in contrast with Aspen's cousin, who tries to use their power as little as possible, this is shown in them not having any local friends, having only online friends means that they will never have to steal from them.</p></span>

					<h2>Prompt 2: Discuss the author’s purpose</h2>
					<h5>March 17, 2020</h5>
					
					<p> The author focuses on the fact that Aspen can’t seem to stop stealing thoughts and emotions from other people. When he first meets Leah and realizes <span class="dots"></span><span class="more"> that he is unable to steal from her, he emidilighly wants to spend more time with her as he feels safe in the fact that he won’t be tempted to steal from her. This is where the author first starts to focus on the fact that Aspen has a hard time not using his powers and this is actually the climax of the book. Aspen wrongly thinks that by killing his great-great-grandma will take away everyone's powers but when it doesn’t works his is forced to realize that he is, “Not a person willing and able to make the choice to stop stealing, but a person who preferred to have the choice taken away from , so he’d never have to make it again” (pg 319). This is the last section of the book and it is because the author wants the reader to contemplate decisions like this one for themselves.</p></span>

					<h2>Use of Flashbacks</h2>
					<h5>March 23, 2020</h5>
					
					<p> Every chapter in the book, “Rocks fall, Everyone Dies” starts with a regular section, then there is a section that is before the events of the regular section. <span class="dots"></span><span class="more"> The one exemption to this is the final chapter where instead of back in time the book moves forward in time. This seems to tie into the fact that in the middle of the book, Aspen figures out that the woman who he thinks is his grandma is truly his great-great-great etc. grandma, she is immortal by stealing healt from other people and his real grandma died many years before. In this sense he is shown a whole new version of the past and that parallels the way the reader is constantly given parts of the past. The writing technique also helps build tension in the form of cliff hangers and make the epilogue of the book more meaningful. </p></span>

					<h2>The Craziness of plant domestication. </h2>
					<h5>March 31, 2020</h5>
					
					<p> The book <i>Guns, Germs, And Steel</i> asks the question how did, often toxic, inedible, and small plants become domesticated long before humans had any idea about genetics and punnett squares (pg 114).<span class="dots"></span><span class="more">  The answer is so elegant and intuitive that it shocked me. He explained how plants were domesticated by humans in the most genitact way possible, survival of the fittest. For example most wild almonds are toxic and bad tasting, only 12 are needed to kid a would be farmer, but the toxicity is only controlled by one gene. If a hunter-gatherer eats a wild almond one day that has a mutation that makes it non-toxic, they would likely take more almonds from that bush back to their camp. Perhaps a few of those almonds are dropped near the camp and grow into new bushes. These non-toxic plants now have a competitive advantage over their toxic brothers and thus plants began domestication before humans began agraical.</p></span>

					<h2>Prompt 6: Quote a Passage From the Book and Discuss.
 </h2>
					<h5>March 31, 2020</h5>
					
					<p>“Neither indeigenous herders with access to candidate species over thousands of years, nor modern geneticists, have succeeded in making useful domesticates of large mammals beyond the Ancient Fourteen, which were domesticated by at least 4,500 years ago” (Diamond 168). <span class="dots"></span><span class="more"> This quote from <i>Guns Germs, and Steel</i> illustrates that fact that outside the animals first domesticated between 10,000 and 2,500 B.C. such as Dogs, Cows, Horses, and eleven more. I first found this surprising as I expected that as an understanding of breeding and gene biology got better, humans would begin to domesticate some of the other 140 plus large mammals. I thought why would humans have not by now domesticated species such as zebra, elk, moose, or even something more ambitious like graff. It turns out that the indeigenous herders had quite the eye for breeding the <i>correct</i> mammals, Diamond explains that all modern attempts at domestication fail at being profitable even though the scientist controls the genetic progress of the species. It seems that all species that make remote sense to domesticate were domesticated in a fairly short time span. </p></span>

					<h2>Prompt 16: Compare the time of the story to the present</h2>
					<h5>April 4, 2020</h5>
					
					<p>Chapter 11, “The Lethal Gift of Livestock”, asks the question why were the spread of germs between the European and the Native Americans. The book remarks about how, “If recent reappraisals of the pre-Columbian New World population are correct, it was not far below the contemporary population of Eurasia.  <span class="dots"></span><span class="more">  Some New World cities like Tenochtitlán were among the world’s most populous cities at the time. Why didn’t Tenochtitlán have awful germs waiting for the Spaniards?” One possible reason was the lack of domesticated animals in the New World. Even the animals domesticated in the Americas such as ducks and turkeys were not nearly as prone to giving humans diseases as cows and pigs. Another was the lack of connections between civilizations in the Americas. During the roman times, much of northern Africa, Europ, and Asia and this helped spread the Afro-Eursaiosn diseases. Erupe was home to diseases from all over the world but in the Americas even the massive Aztec Empire had almost no contact with the populations of the Mississippi valley chiefdoms. All of this reminded me of the Coronavirus spreading through the world now, since most counties have greatly limited travel and we can look at the modern differences in preventions between areas. Hyper dense hubs such as New York are being hit the hardest, but social distancing can artificially lower the interactions per square mile. As hunter gatherer societies had low population densities and low interactions per square mile they had a harder time fostering the creation of diseases than the high density connected European cities. </p></span>

					<h2>Importants of Individual Genius</h2>
					<h5>April 7, 2020</h5>
					
					<p>How much do individual genius and inventors affect societal achievements? The book <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> points out how critical inventions such as the <span class="dots"></span><span class="more">“Wright brothers' manned powered airplane was preceded by the manned unpowered gliders of Otto Lilienthal and the unmanned powered airplane of Samuel Langley.” It makes the argument that human invention is a more lengthy process with less one specific person who contributes a novel new idea, but a long line of contributors that show. I can’t say that I agree with this, the book talks often about the invention of writing which it says was only created for sure new in 2 locations. Only two people had the original idea for the world changing technology that is writing which is why I think individual investors are important. </p></span>

					<h2>Prompt 2: Discuss the author’s purpose.</h2>
					<h5>April 10, 2020</h5>
					
					<p>The goal of the book <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> is to answer the question: Why did some places of the world like Europe endup dominant, with more soficitiacited cultures and governments then places like Australia?<span class="dots"></span><span class="more"> I shared this question, specifically I have always been confused how the complex culture of the Americas, some of which were quite aggressive, were so easily wiped out by European germs and guns. After learning the purpose of the book on page five I was no longer surprised at the book's considerable length as it seems like a topic with no true end or anwer. Even though the book uses quite educated langued, its questioning is like a child who keeps asking why. That is why I think the book was so loved when it came out in 1998, it helped answer one of the nagging whys in the human conscious. Another great part of his purpose is that along the way it provides an excellent foundation for learning other history. Now when I’m learning history with Mr. Rose I always can make a connection to what I’ve learned so far in this book.</p></span>

					<h2>Prompt 9. Compare book characters to other characters.</h2>
					<h5>April 20, 2020</h5>
					
					<p>Ok, I know that this is going to stretch the prompt a little, but I’m going to compare the Aztecs state with the Spanish. When it comes to inventions the Aztec were behind, but were not lost on their way to a modern state.<span class="dots"></span><span class="more"> They had a sillabry mixed with logograms that was mainly used for government work, and was not fully wide spread, they had wheels in the form of toys, but never used them for real applications. The Spanish had wheels too, but they also had horses which gave them a practical use for wheels, they also had oxen which allowed them to plow their fields with the wheels that they had invented. The use of plowing made the Spanish farming much more effective than the Aztec farming, the spanish also had more variety of crops, many of which produced more calories per hectare of land then the maze of the Aztec. It seems the history books would say that the most important difference was the amount of deadly diseases found in Spain and the lack there of in the Aztec societies. Nearly all of the world's epidemic diseases come from Eurasia while almost zero come from the Americas. So why was there this disparity in between the Aztec and the Spanish so great. The answer is that of travel, from the romain empire onward there was regular trade between Asia, Europ, and Northern Africa, animals and crops from all over were able to be spread and the diseases that come with these animals came with them. But the Aztecs had almost no communication with even the chiefdoms of the Mississippi valley who’s lamas might have created a use for the Aztec wheel.</p></span>

					<h2>China vs Europe; the blessing and curse of political unification. </h2>
					<h5>April 22, 2020</h5>
					
					<p>A common question that historical sinteses ask is: Why did China, which was a head of Europe for so long, fall behind around the 15 hundreds. The epilogue of the book <i>Germs, Guns, and Steel</i> attempted to give us a reason. <span class="dots"></span><span class="more"> First it cites the control of the seas that China possessed in the 15th century. During that century China sent treasure fleets, cach consisting of hundreds of ships up to 400 ft long as far as the east coast of Africa. That all ended when a new power came into rule in china, they didn’t like oceangoing ships and banned them throughout all of China. This contrasts strongly with Clombuis who asked 4 parties to fund his voyage before the king and queen of Spain finally agreed to fund him. He had a place to go when the Duke of Anjou in France said that he wouldn’t fund him. Sense the first time China was unified politically in 221 B.C. there has been little time where it was split up. In Europe there has never been anything close to political union, currently there are nearly 40 states and that number has never fallen far below 20. When the Chinese authority decided that the whole country should abolish a technology, there was nowhere for it to go, but when one European state abolished a technology, it would simply give their neighbors a chance to get ahead.</p></span>
